* Prefix Node and Channel logging with terse node_id and channel_id.
* EnforcingChannelKeys::{sign_remote_commitment,sign_closing_transaction}
  seem pretty happy to panic, is this ok?
* sign_remote_commitment and sign_closing_transaction return ambiguous errors (untyped).

#### Coverage extension:

Can we get coverage from c-lightning integration tests?

Marked Unimplemented:

Need Real Unit Test:

* MySigner::get_unilateral_close_key

Get Somewhere Else, or Borrow Their Tests Too?:

* byte_utils.rs::slice_{to_{be16, ...}

Needs Further Thought:

* EnforcingChannelKeys::check_keys (maybe not used?)
* test_utils.rs (lots of dead code?)
* tx/script.rs Into<String> for ValidationError
* tx/script.rs untested ValidationError, expect_op, expect_number, expect_script_end, expect_data
* tx/script.rs expect_number PushBytes case
* tx/tx.rs build_commitment_tx {info.offered_htlcs, info.received_htlcs, sort txouts}
* tx/tx.rs (handle_received_htlc_script, handle_offered_htlc_script}
* node/node.rs Channel::sign_remote_commitment_tx_phase2 htlc_signature in sigs
